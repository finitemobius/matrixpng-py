Reversibly store 2-D matrix data in human-viewable PNG files

The idea is to take data in a 2-D matrix and store it in a PNG, and then be able to recover that data. That way, a human can look at the PNG and interpret the data directly, without having to have separate storage and display functionality.

I'm starting with grayscale and [Extended Black Body](http://www.kennethmoreland.com/color-advice/#extended-black-body) RGB.

I have to give credit to [Sciumo](https://github.com/Sciumo) for the original idea and proof of concept using JavaScript. If I can find the original demonstration online, I will link it here.
